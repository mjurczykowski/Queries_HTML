# Queries and Classses

The purpose of this project is to query the HTML and enable buttons to change the classes of div-tags, effective altering their appearance.

### Color Buttons
When you click a color button, it activates a function in the external javascript file.  Program each function to insert a new class and remove the other potential classes.


**For example:**  If you activate the green50() function.  You should also remove the other classes green25, green75, and green100 before adding the green50 class.  Since there are 4 div-tags you should use a for-loop to change all of the div-tags.


### Box Sizes
Currently in the CSS file, the 4 boxes are floated left but their widths are set by default to 100%.  By clicking the other buttons you will decrease the widths of the boxes by adding and removing the classes that are there.  Use if and else statements to check the presence of classes.
